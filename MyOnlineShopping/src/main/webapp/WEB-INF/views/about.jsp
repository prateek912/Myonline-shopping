			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>People tend to think that "About Us" pages have to sound
				formal to gain credibility and trust. But most people find it easier
				to trust real human beings, rather than a description that sounds
				like it came from an automaton. Trying to sound too professional on
				your "About Us" page results in stiff, copy and design the perfect
				way to make sure your company blends in with the masses.</p>
